# crystal-zero-delay
A simple fabric mod that allows you to entirely remove the delay between placing and breaking end crystals in minecraft - please keep in mind this might be considered cheating on some servers


Its like literally 5 lines of code lmao
theres no check for singleplayer so crystal pvp in singleplayer breaks somewhat.
