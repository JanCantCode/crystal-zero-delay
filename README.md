# crystal-zero-delay
A simple fabric mod that allows you to entirely remove the delay between breaking end crystals in minecraft - please keep in mind this might be considered cheating on some servers
(similar to marlows optimizer, not copied, i released this before she released her optimizer)

Its like literally 5 lines of code lmao
theres no check for singleplayer so crystal pvp in singleplayer breaks somewhat.
